LinkedU
=======
Social Networking Application for Students and Universities' recruiters
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

A web-based LinkedIn like app for high schoolers to link to universities and peers." The idea is to provide an analog of how professionals network with peers and how potential employers may recruit professionals from the network, a service currently found in social networking sites such as LinkedIn

#### <i class="icon-file"></i> Summary

The app targets high school students from anywhere who are looking for a easy and effective way to promote themselves to the university communities. It also targets university recruiters who are looking for talented students with high academic standards and/or athletic abilities. The state of the current college admission process is still an antiquated way of applying for admission (from the students' perspective) and recruiting for qualified, talented, and interested students (from the recruiters' perspective). Imagine how a more competitive landscape (it is getting that way!) where a high student can simply go to LinkedU and provide all the necessary info (e.g., ACT, SAT, PSAT/NMSQT scores, an essay of choice, universities of choice, majors of choice, mixtapes of activities (e.g., basketball moves, musical performances, etc.), etc.) and let the process takes its course. Now, the recruiters can go to LinkedU and scour the candidates for ones who match their targets. They can then attempt to woo the students with scholarships, promotional materials, etc.
